# Hello-world
My first Git Hub Repository
I'm creating this repoitory on Github to work on a project of great peronal and professional interet to me. I'm an information analyst with more than 10 years experience developing applications for the State of Wisconsin's Medicaid Information Management Systems. In 2009 I was laid off and subsequently found myself in a position where I needed to take a leave of absence from the workforce to care for a sick relative. I'm now ready to get back into the work force & I'm creating this github repository to work on an open source project that is of great personal and profesional interet to me. I know this work will be of great value to people in my community and will help me to brush up my software development skill & hopefully help me to find gainful employment.
